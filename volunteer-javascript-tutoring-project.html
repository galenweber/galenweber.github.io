        <h1 class="header">Volunteer JavaScript tutoring project</h1>
        <p>Through April 1, 2022, I'll be offering tutoring in JavaScript and "JavaScript-based" languages (Node, TypeScript) via Discord chat and a Zoom room.</p>
        <p>Tutoring is free for anyone who feels they need help right now.</p>
        <p>I can probably only effectively tutor fluent English speakers (unfortunately, I'm not fluent in any other language).</p>
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>Just DM me on Discord with your question! Username: Galen#7680. If you like, you can join my server using the link below, which may make it easier to DM me directly.</p>
        <a href="https://discord.gg/6QacvhfbeU">https://discord.gg/6QacvhfbeU</a>
        <p>You can also hop into the Zoom room (DM me on Discord for the password):</p>
        <a href="https://us04web.zoom.us/j/75132151566">https://us04web.zoom.us/j/75132151566</a>
        <h3>Format</h3>
        <p>I'll do my best to answer any question you send me, either in writing, a recorded video, or in the Zoom room. I'll try to provide an answer that helps you learn.</p>
        <p>I think the "value-add" for this type of service is to answer questions that you can't post to Stack Overflow. Questions like: "Why isn't this function passing this test case?".</p>
        <h3>Times</h3>
        <p>Monday-Friday, 8:30am-9:30am Eastern Time</p>
        <p>I won't be available while on vacation. All vacation times will be posted here (see below) and in the Discord server.</p>
        <h3>Upcoming vacation</h3>
        <p>November 24-26, 2021</p>
        <p>December 1-10, 2021</p>
        <p>December 24, 2021 - January 6, 2022</p>
        <p>March 14-17, 2022</p>
        <p>April 11-15, 2022</p>
