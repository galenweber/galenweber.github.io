        <h1 class="header">Volunteer JavaScript tutoring project</h1>
        <p>Through April 2022, I'll be offering tutoring in JavaScript and "JavaScript-based" languages (Node, TypeScript) via chat, recorded video, <a href="/vr-javascript-tutoring.html">and VR</a>.</p>
        <p>Tutoring is free for anyone who is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Low income (OR)</li>
            <li>From a group that is underrepresented in tech (OR)</li>
            <li>Feels they need help right now</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I can probably only effectively tutor fluent English speakers (unfortunately, I'm not fluent in any other language).</p>
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>Just message me on Discord! Join my server using the link below, and DM your question. Stack Overflow has a <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">good guide on writing good questions ↗</a>.</p>
        <a href="https://discord.gg/6QacvhfbeU">https://discord.gg/6QacvhfbeU</a>
        <h3>Format</h3>
        <p>I'll do my best to answer any question you send me, either in writing, a recorded video, or in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oculus.com/workrooms/">"Horizon Workroom" ↗</a> (see <a href="/vr-javascript-tutoring.html">VR JavaScript tutoring</a> for more detail). I'll try to provide an answer that helps you learn.</p>
        <p>I think the "value-add" for this type of service is to answer questions that you can't post to Stack Overflow. Questions like: "Why isn't this function passing this test case?".</p>
        <p>To start, I <i>won't</i> be offering synchronous tutoring over video.</p>
        <h3>Times</h3>
        <p>Monday-Friday, 8:30am-9:30am Eastern Time</p>
        <p>I won't be available while on vacation. All vacation times will be posted here (see below) and in the Discord server.</p>
        <h3>Upcoming vacation</h3>
        <p>November 24-26</p>
        <p>December 1-10</p>
